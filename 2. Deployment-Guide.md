# Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to quickly set up the Wi-Fi event network using the prepared equipment (Router + APs + PoE cables).

## 1. Network Topology

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX



- **Omada APs (EAP713)** broadcast the same SSID across 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands.  
- Multiple APs ensure coverage and user load balancing.

## 2. Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1. Connect the Router
1. Plug the WAN port of the Buffalo Router into the wall LAN port (event venue).  
2. Power on the router.  
3. Ensure NAT and DHCP are enabled (already pre-configured).  

### Step 2. Connect Access Points
1. Connect each AP (EAP713) to the Buffalo Router using PoE-enabled Ethernet cables.  
2. Verify PoE LEDs are on (AP powered).  
3. APs will automatically broadcast the **pre-configured SSID**.  

### Step 3. Verify Wi-Fi
1. Use a laptop/phone to scan Wi-Fi.  
2. Find the SSID (e.g., `Reitaku-Keio-2025`).  
3. Enter the printed password to connect.  
4. Test internet access.

## 3. Quick Troubleshooting

- **Cannot connect to Wi-Fi** → Double-check SSID & password label.  
- **No IP address assigned** → Ensure Buffalo Router DHCP is enabled.  
- **AP not powering up** → Verify PoE cable is properly connected.  
- **Weak signal** → Relocate APs for better coverage.

## 4. Additional Notes
- WPA2/WPA3 mixed mode is enabled (older devices can still connect).  
- Bandwidth set to **80 MHz** on 5 GHz band for high throughput.  
- Guest network is isolated to prevent device-to-device access.

Once powered and connected, the system is plug-and-play.
