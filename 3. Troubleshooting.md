# Troubleshooting Guide

This document lists common issues encountered during event network setup and provides quick solutions.

---

## 1. Wi-Fi Cannot Be Found
**Symptoms:** Devices cannot see the SSID in Wi-Fi list.  
**Possible Causes & Solutions:**
- AP not powered → Check PoE connection and cable. Ensure PoE LED is lit.  
- AP not adopted by controller → Reboot AP and check connection to router.  
- SSID broadcast disabled → Verify in Omada Controller that "SSID Broadcast" is enabled.  

---

## 2. Unable to Connect (Password Incorrect)
**Symptoms:** Device prompts "Incorrect password."  
**Possible Causes & Solutions:**
- Wrong SSID selected → Confirm with printed SSID label.  
- Password mistyped → Re-check printed password (case sensitive).  
- Security mismatch → Older devices may not support WPA3 only. **Solution:** Use WPA2/WPA3 mixed mode (already pre-configured).  

---

## 3. Device Gets No IP Address
**Symptoms:** Device connects to Wi-Fi but no internet / no IP assigned.  
**Possible Causes & Solutions:**
- Router DHCP disabled → Ensure Buffalo router DHCP is enabled.  
- DHCP pool too small → Increase DHCP range in Buffalo router settings (e.g., up to 248 clients).  
- Network cable disconnected → Verify Buffalo router WAN port is properly connected to wall LAN.  

---

## 4. Weak Signal or Poor Coverage
**Symptoms:** Some users cannot get stable connection in certain areas.  
**Possible Causes & Solutions:**
- AP placement too close together or blocked → Reposition APs for better coverage.  
- Too many users on one AP → Deploy multiple APs (same SSID) to balance load.  

---

## 5. Slow Internet Speed
**Symptoms:** Wi-Fi connects but speed is very low.  
**Possible Causes & Solutions:**
- Channel width too low → Set 5 GHz/6 GHz channel width to **80 MHz**.  
- Wrong band usage → Encourage users with modern devices to connect to 5 GHz/6 GHz SSID.  
- Venue upstream bandwidth limited → If issue persists, limitation is likely with venue’s internet connection.  

---

## 6. AP Not Showing in Controller
**Symptoms:** AP device not listed in Omada Controller.  
**Possible Causes & Solutions:**
- AP not powered → Check PoE power supply.  
- Wrong VLAN or IP range → Ensure AP is in same network as controller.  
- Re-adopt AP manually via Controller.

✅ With these steps, most setup issues can be quickly diagnosed and solved. For advanced debugging, check the **Omada Controller Logs** or Buffalo Router logs.
